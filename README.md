#Emacs Fast Start

This is a repo to help users to start use Emacs. In this code I choose the essencial packages and configurations to have a happy start with this amazing editor.

## Instalation

Before start, make shure that you don't have `.emacs` and `.emacs.d` in your home directory:

```
ls -la ~/ | grep emacs
```

This command must not return anything!

Since you don't have any of that files in your home, let's begin!  
Clone the repo:

```
git@github.com:squiter/emacs-fast-start.git
```
Them enter in repo directory:

```
cd emacs-fast-start
```

Them make it:

```
make
```
This steps will copy `.emacs` and `.emacs.d` to your home directory.

Ok, that's it! :)

## Starting with Emacs

### Downloading

I'm a OSX user and I recommend you to use one of these builds for Emacs:

* [Emacs for OSX ](http://emacsformacosx.com/);
* [Emacs Mac Port](https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport/releases);
* To know all diferences for the builds I recommend you to read this [Stack Overflow answer](What is the difference between Aquamacs and other Mac versions of Emacs?).

### Learning more

First of all, you must understand how to speak Emacs's Language:

* `C` is `ctrl`;
* `M` is `Meta` that in my configuration is `alt`;
* `S` is `Super` that in my configuration is `command`.

When I said `C-h t` you must to push `ctrl` and `h` key simultaniously, release it and press `t` key.


#### Tutorial

Now I recommend you to open your Emacs and type: `C-h t` and do the EmacsTutorial.
